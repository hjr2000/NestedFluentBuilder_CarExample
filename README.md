### Java Nested Fluent Builder - Car Example

Note: Source material used to help create this code: http://theflyingkeyboard.net/java/java-nested-fluent-builder/

The purpose of the program is to test out some nested fluent builder code. The program allows us to build a simple car. 

In the implementation as it stands, all attributes have a default value and are only changed
when we specify them explicitly.

##### Running the code
